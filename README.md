# How does it work?
The exploit works by confusing the Kami, EquatIO, or Assessment Assistant extensions on Chrome OS.
It may still work even if you can't see any of these extensions in the toolbar.

# Not working?
This exploit will ONLY work on Chrome OS devices that are logged into a managed account.
If you're using another type of device (Windows, Mac) or an unmanaged Chromebook, there are (easier) working bypass methods that you can find elsewhere.
