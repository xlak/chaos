# Chaos Exploit
This is a bypass method for certain web filters and monitoring software on school-managed Chromebooks.

To use it, go to [xlak.github.io/chaos](https://xlak.github.io/chaos)

# Not working?
[Try This Instead](https://github.com/xlak/alphabetic)

This exploit will ONLY work on Chrome OS devices that are logged into a managed account.
If you're using another type of device (Windows, Mac) or an unmanaged Chromebook, there are (easier) working bypass methods that you can find elsewhere.

✖ = Not supported (yet)

🧪 = Untested / Not reliable

✔️ = Tested and fully working

# How does it work?
The exploit works by confusing the Kami, EquatIO, or Assessment Assistant extensions on Chrome OS.
It may still work if you don't have these extensions installed, they just need to be enabled in the organization.
