# What is this?
This is a bypass method for Hapara Highlights and Hapara Filter.
To use it, go to [xlak.github.io/chaos](https://xlak.github.io/chaos)

# How does it work?
The exploit works by confusing the Kami extension or the EquatIO extension on Chrome OS.
It may still work even if you can't see any of those two extensions in the toolbar.

# Not working?
This exploit will ONLY work on Chrome OS devices that are managed by an organization.
If you're using another type of device (Windows, Mac) or an unmanaged Chromebook, there are (easier) working bypass methods that you can find elsewhere.
